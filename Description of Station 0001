Station 0001 is a stackable sphere with a flat top and bottom for connection to the others with massive bolts, railing is used to help adjust and add extra strength.
These massive structures are as wide as 4 jupiters and as tall as 2, on the outside it looked like a metal spheroid, with small ships buzzing about carrying samples of plants or animals for collection and categorization.
On the inside of the sphere are mile long trays with drainage holes that can be opened and closed automatically, thousands of those trays lined the inner wall of this station.
In each of these natural compounds were dumped in, dirt actually, with no spores or seeds just usable nutrients.
Others of the trays were filled with water and the walls were dropped slightly to allow dirt to fall in and create an unatural lake, pond or river.
